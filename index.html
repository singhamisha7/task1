    <h4>* Working of an Elevator - (JAVA, Hibernate, PSQL) —</h4>
    <p>
      Learnt the concepts of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) and ER
      diagram and implemented them while creating the project.A simple ER
      diagram was made and then the JAVA code writing was done, which basically
      comprised of the overall working of the elevator ,it took input from the
      user and then the next steps were recorded. Whether the elevators goes in
      upward direction or in downward direction and the floor selection .After
      completion ,the JDBC (JAVA Database Connectivity) was done so that the
      entries gets stored in the database in tabular form .Postgresql (PSQL)was
      used to store the data in the tabular form. The concept of primary ket
      ,foreign key ,different commands of psql, relation of one table to another
      were learnt .
    </p>
    <h4>* Employee Management System - (JAVA, JSP, PSQL, Hibernate )</h4>
    <p>
      This focused on the employees of an organisation , to keep a record of
      their names , email, password, gender, contact details.The details were
      entered manually and was stored in the database (PSQL) so that it could be
      fetched later. This basically focused on the CRUD Operation where C stands
      for create, R for read, U for update and D for delete. The user can add a
      new employee, update the details of an already existing employee, can view
      all the existing employees and delete any employee’s record.The frontend
      was made using JSP which comprised of HTML pages. It helped in navigating
      through operations and pages while clicking buttons .The concept of
      primary ket ,foreign key ,different commands of psql,relation of one table
      to another, Servlet Mapping, Tomcat Configuration ,HTML, CSS, forms,
      buttons were learnt.This was running on a local server Tomcat

      details of a customer having an account in a bank. The details were
      entered manually by the user on a form which was made using JSP .After
      clicking on the submit button the records were saved on the database in a
      tabular form and which could be fetched later. This basically focused on
      the CRUD Operation where C stands for create which means adding new
      records,R for reading the already existing records in the database, U for
      updating an existing record in the database and D for deleting the
      records.These operations can also be done using the queries of the
      database. The frontend was designed using the JSP(JAVA Servlet Pages) and
      the backend was designed using SpringBoot. The basics of SpringBoot , and
      running the program without having any frontend using Postman , Tomcat
      Configuration was learnt.This was running on a local server Tomcat
